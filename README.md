# Sentiment Analysis
My project where I try different ways to predict sentiment in user's text.

Dataset I used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdismielhossenabir/sentiment-analysis

This is my first try to make a pet-project with a UI.

**My conclusion:** This try is not very good because of its bad structure and my low experience.

Problems I see now:

* The structure is not optimized
* Bad code (code is not optimized and precomputation is done badly)
* The dataset I chose is too small for the methods I used

****

**So, someday I will come back to this project and make a better version.**
